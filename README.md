# FasterStreamClustering
This repo aims to develop some efficient and effective streaming clustering algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art algorithms such as StreamKM++.

### Usage
We only support MacOS and Linux currently.
```
cd FasterStreamClustering
make
./main
```
Then you can see results printed in the command line.
